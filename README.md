### The approach was taken: 

The approach taken during this project was focused on creating the backend first. Using a two model, create a CRUD with RESTful foute. Then I created the client side using ReactJS. The app is stiled using Bootstrap and Reactstrap. 

### Unsolved problems: 

The App is not finished. It needs CRUD and also finishing the routes and stile the components

### Notes to self: 

Continue working on developing the routes.
